**Currently, I am working on my Master Thesis on Log Analytics and Anomaly Detection at Electrolux, Stockholm.**

I come from Gorizia, a multicultural city in Italy, located on the border with Slovenia. There, I completed my secondary education in a Scientific Gymnasium, where I received a comprehensive and consistent education and the incomparable ability of critical thinking. Thanks to my educational background, I managed to successfully branch out in several scientific fields during my career and I have been able to wholly overcome every challenge that stood before me. After having studied in many different countries during these recent years, I am now attending the second year of a MSc in Data Science and Engineering at KTH in Stockholm. 

I spent the first years of my academic education in Trieste, Italy (btw, [you should definitely visit it](assets/images/trieste.jpg)), where I studied Computer and Electronics Engineering, thanks to which I have been able to take the future steps of my career. 

During the bachelor's, I have lived in Graz, Austria for almost a year and a half. There, I studied Computer Science for an academic year as an exchange student at the Graz University of Technology. Soon after that, I interned as a Software Devloper in the Hardware Validation and Verfication Team at NXP Semiconductor. 

In 2018, I started a double degree MSc in Data Science and Engineering powered by EIT Digital. For this reason, I have lived and studied in Eindhoven, the Netherlands for a year before moving to Stockholm.

Throughout my studies, I have been in contact with many different fields within Computer Science and Engineering. This granted me the possibility to understand and succeed in a lot of diverse challenges. 

I am very passionate about cinema and music, which both usually take most of my free time. I also have a deep knowledge of the video game industry and I like to think of myself as a tech-savvy person.
